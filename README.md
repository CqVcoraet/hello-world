# About Me
Hello, my name is Conny and I am a freshman university student. I am someone who loves to be full stack in multiple branches of engineering and science and even including spirituality. This is because I believe that this will be required for many of my dream inventions to become a reality and because you cannot understand reality fully without totality and holistic thinking. I believe this kind of mindset will breed the next generation of scienists and engineers.
